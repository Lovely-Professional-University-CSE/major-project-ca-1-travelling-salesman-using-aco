Travelling salesman problem (TSP) consists of finding the shortest route in complete weighted graph G with n nodes 
and n(n-1) edges, so that the start node and the end node are identical and all other nodes in this tour are visited exactly once. 

The most popular practical application of TSP are:
regular distribution of goods or resources, finding of the shortest of costumer servicing route, planning bus lines etc., 
but also in the areas that have nothing to do with travel routes.

The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the best known NP-hard problems, which means that there is no exact algorithm 
to solve it in polynomial time. The minimal expected time to obtain optimal solution is exponential. So, for that reason, we
usually use heuristics to help us to obtain a “good” solution. Many algorithms were applied to solve TSP with more or less success.
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits. The basic characteristic is the ability to reach optimal 
solution: exact algorithms or heuristics.
